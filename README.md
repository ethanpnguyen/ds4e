ME 379M: Data Science For Engineers

**Outline:** This course provides students with the knowledge to analyze and interpret data sets using 
industry-standard  methodology.  Key  skills  include  learning  how  to  clean,  visualize,  and  perform 
industry-specific  analysis  on  large  data  sets.    Using  predictive  analysis  and  machine  learning, 
students  will  build  models  to  make  defensible  connections  in  the  data.  Upon  finishing  this  model, 
students will verify/validate their hypothesis and conclusions. The course culminates in the creation 
of an interactive dashboard presenting the given correlations. By “telling the story” of their journey 
through the data, students will relay the skills they learned to their peers.
